    Step 2. Set the depth you want the computer player to search till. Higher the depth more
          intelligent would be the AI and lesser the depth less intelligent decisions will be taken by the
           AI.You can set the depth as an integer from 1 to anything, just here 3*3 board so 9 depth is the
          max we can go.We took 10 to be safe.So if you don't set any depth then it is 10 by default.
